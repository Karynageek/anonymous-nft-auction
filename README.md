# Smart Contract with Encrypted Bidding on Cypher Testnet

 This repository contains the code for a smart contract deployed on the Cypher Testnet, designed to facilitate encrypted bidding using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). The auction allows users to place bids on NFTs while maintaining the confidentiality of their bids.

With encryption, all bids are processed without revealing the bid amounts to other participants, providing enhanced privacy and security in decentralized auctions.
