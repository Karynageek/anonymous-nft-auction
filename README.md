# Project Title: Smart Contract with Encrypted Bidding on Cypher Testnet

## Overview

Welcome to [Project Title]! This repository contains the code for a smart contract deployed on the Cypher Testnet, designed to facilitate encrypted bidding using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). The auction allows users to place bids on NFTs while maintaining the confidentiality of their bids.

With encryption, all bids are processed without revealing the bid amounts to other participants, providing enhanced privacy and security in decentralized auctions.

## Features

-   Encrypted Bidding: Utilizes Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to keep bid amounts confidential throughout the bidding process.
-   NFT Auction System: Bidders compete for NFTs, with the highest bid determining the winner.
-   Cypher Testnet Deployment: Deployed on Cypherâ€™s testnet, leveraging its secure and scalable network for testing.
-   Efficient Contract Architecture: Modular and optimized for gas efficiency.
-   Secure Withdrawals: Bidders can withdraw funds after the auction ends, and the NFT is transferred to the winner.
